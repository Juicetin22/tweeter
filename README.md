# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone utilizing jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, and CSS3 that allows users to post messages (ie. tweets) on the page. Watch the magic unfold before your eyes as you see the seamless transition from posting a tweet to having it appear in the feed without refreshing the page!
